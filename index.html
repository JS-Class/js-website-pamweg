        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>
            I was born in <strong>Virgina</strong> but raised in <strong>NW Ohio</strong> for 
            most my life. I graduated from highschool in 2009 and married
            my wife in 2013. <br><br>

        <h3>Family</h3>

        <p>
            I have two brothers and one sister. I am lucky to still have my mom
            and dad with me but I have a funny story of my dad passing away
            one day. Ask me in person to get the full story. <span class="iAmMarried">I am 
            married to my lovley wife Vonda and we have no kids.</span> I am also 
            blessed to have <span class="iAmMarried">10 </span>necies and nephews with two 
            of them being my god child.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>

        <p>
            I am a nerd so games are a huge hobbie for me but a couple random
            ones people don't know are Bee keeping and Hunting. I also enjoy using my
            3d printer and collecting <em>Pokemon</em> cards.
